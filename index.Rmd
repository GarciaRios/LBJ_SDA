#### Some words from LBJ:

##### _The central fact of our times is this: Books and ideas are the most effective weapons against intolerance and ignorance_
###### Lyndon B. Johnson atsigning the Library Services Act amendment on February 11, 1964. 



##### _The land flourished because it was fed from so many sources--because it was nourished by so many cultures and traditions and peoples_

### Overview and Class Goals

This seminar equips graduate students with the knowledge and skills needed to design and execute rigorous survey research, with a focus on public opinion and political science applications. We'll explore the entire research process, from formulating questions and sampling, to crafting questionnaires, analyzing data, and interpreting results. We'll delve into diverse methodologies, including mixed methods, and keep up with the latest theoretical and practical advancements in the field.

### Tips for success:

* Complete the reading before a new unit begins, and then review again after the unit is over.
* Be an active participant during class.
* Ask questions - during class or office hours, or by email. Ask me, and your classmates.
* Do the problem sets - start early and make sure you attempt and understand all questions.
* Start your projects early and and allow adequate time to complete them.
* Give yourself plenty of time time to prepare a good cheat sheet for exams. This requires going through the material and taking the time to review the concepts that you're not comfortable with.
* Do not procrastinate - don't let a unit go by with unanswered questions as it will just make the following unit's material even more difficult to follow. 

* * *



### Email, Canvas, and Slack: 

You can find all the relevant information for this course on this website. 

Canvas will be be primarily used as a dropbox for assignments submissions. All of your assignments will be submitted through Canvas. You have to submit a HTML document and RMarkdown file. Canvas has trust issues with html files so you might have to submit a zipped folder with  both files. More on this later.



It is often more efficient to answer questions in person, so try to ask them in class. However, if you want to reach the teaching team outside of class time the preferred method of communication will through Slack. If you run into coding issues you can send direct messages to us but I encourage you use the _#ProblemSets_ channel where we will try to troubleshoot the issues collectively (class and teaching team). My experience is that if you have a question or are  running into  coding issues at least someone else in the class might have the same question. 

Of course, you can always email us but try to limit problem-set and coding questions to Slack

Slack will be particularly important as we develop an deploy our survey

### Course structure:

The course is divided into six learning units. For each unit a set of learning objectives and required and suggested readings will be posted on the course website. You are expected to complete the readings and familiarize yourselves with the learning objectives. Slides and other relevant materials for each class and lab will be available on the [calendar](./calendar) page before each class. Videos and other relevant prep materials for each unit are also available on that page. Within each unit you will complement your learning with problem sets and labs, and wrap up each unit with a performance assessment.



### Grading:

* * *

### Work load:

You are expected to put in about 4-6 hours of work / week outside of class. Some of you will do well with less time than this, and some of you will need more.

* * *

### Attendance and participation:

You are expected to be present at class meeting and actively participate in the discussion. Your attendance and participation during class will make up a non-insignificant portion of your grade in this class. While I might sometimes call on you during the class discussion, it is your responsibility to be an active participant without being called on. 



* * *



### Labs (5):

The objective of the labs is to give you hands on experience with data analysis using modern statistical software. The labs will also provide you with tools that you will need to complete the projects successfully. We will use a statistical analysis software called R Studio, which is a front end for the R statistical language.

I will give a brief overview of the lab and learning goals, and guide you through some of the exercises. You will start working on the lab during the class session, but note that the labs are designed to take more than just the class time, so you will work on the lab after class and sub,it it before the due date (which will be the following lab session). In order to get credit for a lab report, you must be in the lab session on the day that lab is introduced.

**Submission instructions:** Always submit the Rmd and the HTML files for your lab, you might need to create .zip file in order to submit.



* * *

### Short Writing Assignments (4):


There will be 4 short writing  assignemnts these are all designed to dive deeper into survey design. These assignments serve a dual purpose:

 - Gearing up for your group project: They equip you with crucial skills to tackle different aspects of your collaborative survey project, from crafting effective questions to analyzing data.

 
- Mastering key lessons: Each assignment focuses on a specific area of survey design or analysis, allowing you to independently deepen your understanding and confidence.


Two assignments will be individual endeavors, testing your independent mastery of specific skills and concepts. The remaining two will be collaborative, fostering teamwork and communication as you work together on crucial aspects of your group project. These collaborative assignments will provide you with invaluable experience in applying your knowledge in a real-world setting, simulating the challenges and rewards of collaborative research.

Further details on the projects will be provided as due dates approach


* * *

### Projects:

The objective of the projects is to give you independent applied research experience using real data and statistical methods. There will be two components:



*Group Write-Up Project (Weeks 14-15):* Co-authored research article based on collaborative survey project (Each member contributes to sections and revises the entire manuscript)

*Individual Research Paper (Week 15):* Independent research paper using data from either your own survey or the 2022 LBJ Univision Poll (Choose research topic, analyze data, present findings in paper and presentation)


Further details on the projects will be provided as due dates approach.
